# Workout Tracking App

This app allows users to track their workouts, including the muscle groups, exercises, and weights/reps in each set. The purpose is to let users track the weights used in each exercise so that they don't have to mentally keep track. It will also display progress over time. 

This app is in progress, and I'm slowly adding to it over time. It is currently not fully functional.
